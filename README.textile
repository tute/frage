h2. Survey plugin for CakePHP

This plugin allows the creation of surveys, which can have one or many questions.

I'm currently actively developing it.

h3. It relies on:

* Inflection ('opcion' => 'opciones') (@bootstrap.php@)
* Authentication component, with 'Usuario' model name.

h3. Possible type of questions:
# Yes or No
# Values 1 to 5
# Free text
# Options defined by administrator (developing)
