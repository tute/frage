h2. Survey plugin for CakePHP

This plugin allows the creation of surveys, which can have many questions. Each
question can be of type "yes/no", values 1 to 5, free text or with custom
options.

I'm currently actively developing it.

h3. Currently relies on:

* Inflection ('opcion' => 'opciones') (@bootstrap.php@)

Type of questions:
# Yes / No
# Values 1 to 5
# Free text
# Custom options (developing)
